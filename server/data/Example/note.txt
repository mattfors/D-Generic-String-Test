F150 Zyex Composite Pro-Arte Strings

Summary

These composite strings have been well received. The sound is very good, and their response is quite similar to that of
the Pro-Arte basses albeit with a few differences, to my amateur ears, they sounded a little bit brighter and fuller, they
also had slightly better sustain. There is very little difference between the Pro-Arte and Zyex core classical strings with
regards to the results of the stretch test, the Zyex was marginally more consistent. Here is the data from the stretch test.
